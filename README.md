To ensure that the XP system is safe and secure, it's important to track all XP transactions and activities within the platform. blockchain nature will provide that for us, it allows for a transparent and immutable record of all XP transactions. This not only provides a level of security and trust within the system, but it also allows for easy querying of xp activities if needed, for example in the event of an unexpected issue or problem.
